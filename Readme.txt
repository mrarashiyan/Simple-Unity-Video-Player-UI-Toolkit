# Welcome to Unity Video Player!

This is a simple Video Player project fully made with new **Unity UI Toolkit**. 
I made this project for Training and Learning new UI system. In this project you find my idea on Project Structure, Foldering, Scripting Modules and Connecting them to eachother.


## Key Features
1- Open any Video Files inside the Unity and Load it in **UI Toolkit**.

2- **Fully Functional** Video Controllers part; including **Time Seek, Play/Pause Button, Volume Controll. Caption Activator, Full Screen Mode**

3- Use different structure for **Selectors**

4- **Transition Animation** with USS and C#

5- Used different type of **Customize Controllers**; including Label, Button, Toggle, Slider, and Dropdown

6- Fully **Responsive** Design for any Screen Size!

7- **Reuseable Code Structure** for other UI Toolkit projects

## How To Use

1- Clone the project and import it to the Unity. My version is 2022.3.13 LTS, but you can use any other version.
2- Open the following Scene file: `Assets/_Projects/Scene/Video Player` 
3- Play the Scene, and Press on **`+`** button on top left to Open a video inside the Editor.

If you want to **Build** the project on your device, just replace the **OpenFilePanel** with your own Open File Dialogue system in `HeaderSection.cs` script
